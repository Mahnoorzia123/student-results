# Student Results 📊
A beginner-friendly Python project using **pandas** to create and export student marks data.

## Features
- Stores data for 5 students with their marks in Math, Science, and English.
- Creates a pandas DataFrame to organize the data.
- Exports the data to a CSV file (`student_results.csv`).

## Code Explanation
- 'pd.DataFrame(data)' creates a table from a dictionary.
- 'to_csv()' saves the table to a CSV file.
- 'index=False' means row numbers aren’t saved.

## Example Output
Name   Class  Math  Science  English
0 Ali 8th 85 80 78
1 Sara 8th 92 95 88
2 Ahmed 8th 78 75 82
3 Zara 8th 90 85 91
4 Hassan 8th 88 90 85

Perfect, Eshmal! 🎉 That’s even better — having both the Python file and the CSV file makes your project look more complete and professional.

Let’s make sure you upload both files properly 👇

🪜 Step-by-Step: Upload Python + CSV files to GitHub
🧩 Step 1: Prepare your files
Make sure these two files are saved in one folder on your computer:

Copy code
student_results.py
student_results.csv
🗂 Step 2: Open your GitHub repository
Go to your GitHub profile.

Open your repository (for example, student-results).

📁 Step 3: Upload both files
Inside the repo, click “Add file → Upload files.”

Drag and drop both files (.py and .csv).

Scroll down and click “Commit changes.”

✅ Done! Both your Python script and your CSV dataset will now appear in your GitHub repository.

🧾 Step 4: Update your README file
